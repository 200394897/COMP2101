# this script generates a report of the files on the system that have the setuid permission bit turned on
# it is for the lab1 exercise
# it uses the find command to find files of the right type and with the right permissions, and an error redirect to
# /dev/null so we do not get errors for inaccessible directories and files
# the identified files are sorted by their owner

# Task 1 for the exercise is to modify it to also find and display the setgid files in a second listing
# The second listing should display after the setuid file list, and be formatted similar to the
# setuid file list including having a title
# use the find command to find files of the right type and with the right permissions, and an error redirect to
# /dev/null so we do not get errors for inaccessible directories and files
# the identified files should be sorted by their group

# Task 2 for the exercise is to modify it to also display the 10 largest regular files in the system, sorted by their sizes
# The listing should only have the file name, owner, and size in MBytes and be displayed after the listings of
# setuid and setgid files and should have its own title
# use the find command to generate the list of files with their sizes, with an error redirect to /dev/null
# use cut or awk to display only the output desired
